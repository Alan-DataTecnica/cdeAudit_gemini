As "Comments" is a free text entry field, it does not have a specific range or list of . It is expected to contain any clinically relevant information or observation deemed necessary by the healthcare provider.
As a free text field, there are no fixed . However, the comment must adhere to professional language standards, potentially HIPAA compliant (depending on context), and pertinent to the relevant medical information.
As a free-text field, the permissible values can be any text. However
As a free-text field, the permissible values for 'Non traumatic spinal cord injury aetiology axis 1 level 5 other text' are any
As a free-text field, the range of acceptable permissible_values for the biomedical term "Data source other text" would vary based on individual data entries and specification relevant to the data sources. Examples could include "Medical Records", "Personal Feedback", "Lab Results", "Pharmacy Logs", "Imaging Records", etc.
As the 'City' variable constitutes textual data, it cannot be limited to a precisely delimited range or list of acceptable values. The permissible values would comprise the names of all possible cities across the globe. While a comprehensive list is impractical, any valid city name is an acceptable value.
As the biomedical term "Comments" is text-based in nature and specific to individual patients, the range of acceptable permissible_values cannot be predefined. Therefore, in this context, the response is 'N/A'.
As the biomedical term "Mechanical Prophylaxis Type: Other, Other Type" is defined as a "free-text description," it does not
As the biomedical term "Safety monitor survey 4 text" indicates a free-text response and considering the preferred question text, permissible_values aren't strictly defined. However, they could feasibly encompass any narrative or description concerning diet or meal plans in the context of a safety monitoring survey. Therefore, clinically feasible responses could range from descriptions of various dietary plans (e.g. "Vegetarian diet rich in legumes and vegetables") to affirmation of adherence to study-provided meal plans (e.g. "Following study-provided meal plan A").
As the biomedical term 'Medication supplement name' encompasses a wide range of potential feasible entries, it is not feasible to list all potential medications and supplements
As the requested information involves text values rather than numerical values, a range or list of acceptable values is not applicable. The participant/subject can provide any
As this biomedical term "What is your occupation?" pertains to free text data, it does not have a predefined range or set of . The responses will depend on the individual's specific occupation and job description.
As this biomedical term deals with free-text responses, specific permissible values cannot be provided. The response would be based on the specific observations or findings of the healthcare provider.
As this biomedical term indicates a qualitative history, permissible values would include:1. "Nil known"2. "Levodopa"3. "Carbidopa"4. "Pramipexole"5. "Ropinirole"6. "Rasagiline"7. "Selegiline"8. "Amantadine"9. "Entacapone"10. "Apomorphine"11. "Rotigotine"12. "Safinamide"13. "Tolcapone"14. "Unknown medications"
As this is a descriptive biomedical term, the "permissible_values" would be any text answers that adequately describe whether and how other family members have symptoms like the patient's. There is no definite range or list since it is subjective and relies on the patient's text response.
As this is a free-text field, permissible_values would ideally encompass any alphanumeric input. The range of acceptable values could depend heavily on the potential user input related to the specific context. Therefore, an exhaustive list of permissible_values can't be provided.
As this is a free-text field, there are technically no permissible values. The field text should comply with the context and relate to 'Neurom
As this is a name entry field, the permissible values cannot be explicitly listed due to the vast quantity of potential given names and surnames. Any correctly spelled and formatted first and last name will be accepted. Special characters outside of a hyphen or apostrophe in name entries will not be accepted. Names should begin with a capital letter, with the rest in lower case unless there are specific capital letters in the name such as "McDonald" or "O'Riley".
As this is a text-based field requesting descriptive input from a patient or healthcare provider, a specific range or list of permissible values would not be applicable. Detailed patient symptoms, conditions, experiences or medical history related to the systems reviewed would be entered here. Respond with "N/A".
As this is an open-ended question, acceptable permissible_values would be any text-based descriptions of specific adverse drug reactions not listed in previous sections. The responses will vary greatly based on each individual's experience and cannot be standardized to a set list of values.
As this term calls for subjective open-ended text entries, a pre-determined range or list of permissible values cannot be provided. The patient's/subject's individual feedback, comments or concerns entered as free text would be the acceptable values.
As this term is a free text category, there are no fixed permissible values. This allows for a wide range of responses in the form of sentences or phrases that provide additional descriptors or specific details related to the "Cylinder and the craniotomy connector angle type".

Due to the contextual nature of this biomedical term, its permissible_values largely depend on the specific medical case, and thus, may include any valid ICD-10 (International Classification of Diseases, 10th Revision) codes that don't fall within commonly listed categories at the time of a patient's discharge. Therefore, it's not possible to list all permissible values.
Due to the nature of the biomedical term "Comments", a range, list, or specific permissible_values cannot be provided. This term can include any text or alphanumeric character strings that a clinician finds relevant for the patient's health or treatment context. These entries must comply with the rules of patient data protection and confidentiality.
Due to the nature of the term, a specific range or list of permissible values isn't applicable. However, the resolution date should adhere to the format mm/dd/yyyy where mm represents the month (01
Due to the nature of the term, there's no specific range or list of acceptable permissible_values for "Comments". The biomedical term "Comments" is typically free text and the  depend on responses provided by the healthcare professional. Uppercase and lowercase alphabets (A-Z, a-z), numbers (0-9), spaces, and standard punctuation marks would be  to accommodate a wide range of free text responses.
Due to the nature of this biomedical term, a specific range or list of permissible_values cannot be provided as it calls for open-ended, text-based responses pertaining to specific complications or adverse health outcomes not otherwise mentioned related to a COVID-19 infection. Therefore, the response is 'N/A'.
Due to the open-text and potentially varied nature of this biomedical term response there is no specific, predetermined range or list of permissible values. Responses should adhere to clinical appropriateness regarding EEG vocalization types or methods.
Due to the specific nature of component model numbers, which can vary extensively depending on various factors such as device type, brand, etc., it's not possible to provide a fixed range or list of acceptable permissible values. These values would be alphanumeric, set by the manufacturer, and unique to each component. Respond with the specific model number provided by the manufacturer.

Permissible Values for "{med_hx_n_comments}":- Any text string or numeric data that provides further information about the patient's condition. This could include details like onset date, severity, treatment, and other relevant clinical notes. The string must not include any inappropriate language or confidentiality-breaching information.Permissible Values for "{med_hx_n}":- These should be unique alphanumeric identifiers to distinguish each condition. They can be numerical sequences or specific codes related to the condition.Permissible Values for "Other (list) {med_hx_62} {med_hx_62_comments} or {med_hx_63} {med_hx_63_comments}":- Any medical condition not listed in the provided table. - Any text string or numeric data in comments providing further information about the condition (just like "med_hx_n_comments").
Permissible values for "Comments" are not fixed and may range broadly as this field is free text and content varies according to the observer's input, observations, and context. However, text entries should be clear, concise, and adhere to professional clinical language practices.

Since "Comments" is a text field and its content is largely dependent on the context of the situation or the patient, there are no predefined . Any form of text is allowed, with the only limit being any maximum character count specified in the database.
Since "Deviation Event Description" is a narrative or textual report, it does not have predefined permissible_values. Any detailed and comprehensive description of a non-standard or non-typical event in a biomedical environment
Since the "Comments" section is typically free text, the  can include any alphanumeric characters, standard punctuation, emoji and special characters that the data collection and storage system can accept. It includes but not limited to:1. Letters (A-Z; a-z)2. Numbers (0–9)3. Punctuation ([Whitespace], . , ; ! ? : - ' " ‘ ’ “ ” ( ) [ ] { } / \ ~ # < > & _ * + = @ % $ £ € ¥ ¢ § © ® ™ | ` ^ º ª)4. Emoji (😀 to 😾)5. Special Symbols (•, –, —, †, ‡, °,′,″,☉, etc.)Please note, however, that specific systems may limit the types of characters that can be used, and some types of special characters may not be recommended due to difficulty in interpretation or potential confusion with other data notation. So, actual  should be checked against the specific requirements and capabilities of the healthcare facility's data management systems.
Since the data type for "Current_city" is text and involves an infinite range of possible city names worldwide, it is not clinically feasible or practical to provide a comprehensive list of acceptable permissible values. Therefore, the response is "N/A".
Since the device implanted revision component registration number will be unique to each device, there is no fixed list of acceptable values. Instead, it follows a pattern outlined by regulations and the device's manufacturer.

Text
The  for the biomedical term "Comments" can take any string form, as this field is based on user or system input and is context-specific. There is no specific range or list of acceptable values. As such, the data entries can vary widely based on the medical context, patient condition, additional observations, or specific reminders. The text input should follow HIPAA guidelines ensuring confidentiality and privacy. Any offensive, inappropriate language or disclosure of sensitive personal information not related to the patient's health condition is not acceptable.
The acceptable  for this term would include all names or abbreviations of states, provinces, or regions worldwide. Examples include:- All 50 U.S. states (e.g., "Alabama", "Alaska", "Arizona", "Arkansas", etc.) including their standard abbreviations (e.g., "AL", "AK", "AZ", "AR", etc.)- Canadian provinces and territories (e.g., "Alberta", "British Columbia", "Manitoba", "New Brunswick", etc.) including their standard abbreviations (e.g., "AB", "BC", "MB", "NB", etc.)- Regions in countries that are primarily divided by regions rather than states or provinces such as France (e.g., "Auvergne-Rhone-Alpes", "Bourgogne-Franche-Comte", "Bretagne", "Centre-Val de Loire", etc.)Please note this is a non-exhaustive list. The complete list would contain all possible states, provinces, or regions from every country.
The acceptable range for Mean Neuritic Tangle Density in Eight Brain Regions (usually in tangles per mm squared) may widely span from 1.2 to 350. It extensively depends on the specific patient group concern, age, and disease state such as Alzheimer's Disease or routine aging. The typical clinical feasible expected values may appear in much lower ranges in health/n
The biomedical term "Comments" can have a wide range of permissible_values and does not have a specific list of acceptable responses, since it is typically free-text input field. This allows for flexibility in the type and amount of information that can be recorded. As such, any clinically relevant, professional and respectful comments, observations, or clarifications pertaining to the patient's condition or data recorded are considered acceptable.
The biomedical term "Hematoxylin and Eosin Clearing Agent Method Other Specify, Specify Other H&E clearing method" may not have a definitive range or list of permissible values as it is designed to capture alternate methods utilized in the clearing process during H&E slide preparation and thus it is dependent on the specific practices of the clinical or laboratory setting.
The datatype for this field is likely to be text or string, per your diagnostic coding schemes. Therefore, permissible_values cannot be defined exhaustively. Nonetheless, you'd likely utilise codes from a standard clinical vocabulary, such as ICD-10, SNOMED CT, or LOINC, dependent on your exact use-case.In ICD-10, examples of acceptable values might include:- I10: Essential (primary) hypertension- E11: Type 2 diabetes mellitus- J45: AsthmaA SNOMED CT example could be: - 73211009: Diabetes mellitusThis assumes that "Lifetime comorbidity #1" is a coded field utilizing one of these vocabularies. If you're using free-text, you could receive a wide variety of responses such as "hypertension," "type 2 diabetes," "asthma," etc.
The permissible range of values for the WASI-II Matrix Reasoning T Score is 20 to 80.
The permissible values could be any unique integer number starting from 1. For example, 1, 2, 3,..., n where n is the total number of study participants.
The permissible values for 'Device implanted other adverse effect modification description text' are all possible combinations of English language letters, numbers, and usable punctuation marks with a character limit of 500.
The permissible_values for the biomedical term "Q PD social history E explain text" are open text responses of up to 1000 characters in length. This allows for diverse patient responses that detail their personal disease (PD) social history, as appropriate for the context of the question "If yes, please explain." All responses should be patient-reported. Fixed lists or ranges do not apply. Please ensure all responses remain consistent with HIPAA regulations for privacy and patient security.
The permissible_values for this biomedical term would depend on the individual input of the participants. There isn't a specific range or list. An acceptable email should adhere to the general format: [username]@[domain].[extension], where username, domain and extension are contextually relevant strings. It should also be clinically feasible by ensuring the email provided is valid and actively used by the participant.
This biomedical term "Comments" is textual in nature, thus, its  cannot be explicitly defined as it can contain any alphanumeric characters, spaces, and special characters. However, it is expected to be a descriptive or explanatory note related to patient's condition, procedure or data. It's clinically feasible as it provides additional helpful context or information. Hence, the  are highly context-dependent and cannot be explicitly listed or specified.
This biomedical term does not have a predefined range or list of acceptable . It's a free text field, allowing a medical professional to provide their professional opinion and observations about a patient's condition or information that may not be captured in structured data fields. They might include information such as patient's symptoms, diagnosis, treatments and medication changes, or any other relevant commentary. The contents of this field will vary based on the specific context of each individual patient's case.
This biomedical term does not have fixed permissible values as the acceptable inputs are based on the SNOMED CT (Systemized Nomenclature Of Medicine Clinical Terms) code, which is a comprehensive, multilingual clinical healthcare terminology that is used to record patient data in a systematic manner. The permissible values in this context would include any valid SNOMED CT code related to clinical observation outcomes.
This biomedical term doesn't have a set list of , as it is an open text field meant for personalized, descriptive inputs related to individual patient observation and details that don't fit into other categories. Nevertheless, some potential inputs include:- Notes on patient behavior- Observations regarding symptom severity- Commentary on treatment response - Descriptions of unusual or rare symptoms- Information about patient lifestyle impacting health- Personal patient anecdote relatable to medical situation- Anomalies regarding patient medical reports and diagnosis.
This biomedical term is qualitative and requires free-text entries by the respondent. Therefore, a predefined list of permissible values would not be applicable here. Respond: 'N/A'
This information is unique to each patient and cannot have a standard list of permissible values. Hence, the response is 'N/A'.
This is a free-text field hence permissible values could encompass any text that an individual identifies as their gender, this includes, but is not limited to, "agender", "bigender", "pangender", "genderqueer", "androgyne" etc. As this is an open-ended entry, there are no outer limits for the permissible values, and the response is dependent on the individual's self-identified gender identity.
This term accepts free text and therefore doesn't have a predetermined range of permissible values. The information entered should be the detailed subjective symptoms reported by the patient during EEG seizure activity, that are not included in the standard 'EEG ictal subjective symptoms reported type' options.
