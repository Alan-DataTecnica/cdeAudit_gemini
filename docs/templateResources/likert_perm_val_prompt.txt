Instruction: Generate a set of Likert-scale permissible values in a standardized numerical format suitable for assessing the subject '{{ title }}'. Consider the subject matter deeply to create a scale that is precisely relevant, while keeping in mind the general categories of frequency, agreement, quality, and intensity.

### Data Element Details ###
Title: 
"""
 {{read}}
"""

### Guidance for Generating Custom Likert-Scale Values ###
- Develop a response set that matches the context and specificity of '{{ title }}'.
- Use the structured numerical format (0 to 4), with each point clearly defined:
   - 0: Represents the least or lowest intensity/agreement/quality/frequency.
   - 4: Represents the most or highest intensity/agreement/quality/frequency.
- While you may create custom descriptions for each value point, ensure they follow the logical progression from 0 to 4.

### Examples of Likert-Scale Formats to Inspire ###
1. **Frequency**:
   - 0: Never, 1: Rarely, 2: Sometimes, 3: Often, 4: Always
2. **Agreement**:
   - 0: Strongly Disagree, 1: Disagree, 2: Neutral, 3: Agree, 4: Strongly Agree
3. **Quality**:
   - 0: Very Poor, 1: Poor, 2: Average, 3: Good, 4: Excellent
4. **Intensity**:
   - 0: None, 1: Mild, 2: Moderate, 3: Severe, 4: Extremely Severe

### Task ###
- Reflect on the nature of '{{ title }}' and create a set of Likert-scale values that are uniquely suited to it. Consider if modifications to the example categories or entirely new categories are needed based on the subject matter.
- Ensure each value is concisely described and maintains the format of progressive intensity or frequency from least to most.

***Draft a set of custom Likert-scale permissible values for '{{ title }}', presenting them in a standardized numerical format. Ensure the descriptions are clear and directly related to the subject.***
